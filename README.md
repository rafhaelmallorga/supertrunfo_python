# Dyno Super Trunfo

This is a simple card game developed in Python to understand some fundamentals of the language.

This game has a dict of fixed 'dynos' and for each match the code generate random stats for the attributes **Strength, Agility and Height** of all 'dynos'.

With the deck created it divide the cards in two decks and
play the game.

For each round the game chose randomly an attribute to compare between both decks and print which won.
